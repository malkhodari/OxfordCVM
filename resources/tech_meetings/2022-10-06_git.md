### Why git?
- tracking changes
- incremental tracking
- ability to backtrack
- track changes across different contributors
- get latest repository update

### Git vs GitHub
- git is a version control tool
- github is a remote service that hosts codebases
- lots of other remote services similar to github: bitbucket, gitlab etc

### Navigate github repository
- file structure
	- all code inside ```/src/```
	- each subdirecotyr in ```/src/``` has a different function of the workflow
- summary of sub-functions
	- ```/src/aws``` contains the aws code for deployment to aws
	- ```/src/fmrib``` contains the modelling code
	- ```/src/ml_lifecycle``` contains the code for ML models
	- ```/src/visualizations``` contains the code for interactive visualizations
- ```run_UKB_cTI.sh``` file summarizes all the files run in our current workflow

### Clone github repository
```
git clone https://github.com/zhaohanxiong/OxfordCVM.git
```

### check status of current directory
```
git status
```

### add changes
```
git add
git rm
```

### commit changes
```
git commit -m "message here"
```

### push changes to remote repository
```
git push
```

### pull changes from remote repository to local
```
git pull origin
```

### branch
```
git branch
git checkout branch_name
```

### merge
```
git merge base_branch new_branch
```

- can also be done on github via a pull request

### readmes on github
- ```README.md``` displays readme file in a nice way (using html)

### ignoring files so git doesnt track
- we dont want to track files which contain data or sensitive information
- this file located in the base directory
- ```.gitignore``` files

### github workflows
- Located in the Actions tab along the top
- CI/CD
