    "1) keep feature with high ratio of local vs global variance\n",
    "   which correspond to higher probability of being in \n",
    "   trajectory\n",
    "2) use cPCA which focuses more on diseased population\n",
    "   by using 2 covariant matrices to get a weighted difference\n",
    "   between the matrices. also uses multiple weightings \n",
    "   and clusters them based on proximity to princical angle\n",
    "   to reduce to few subspaces. instead of visual inspection\n",
    "   in original algorithm, use gap clustering criteria (matlab)\n",
    "    1) main purpose of PCA is to reduce high dimensional data\n",
    "        down into 2 basic components, and highly correlated variables\n",
    "        cluster together in the 2D PCA representation. Distances\n",
    "        between each PC is also more significant for 1st component\n",

    "3) order subjects according to their proximity to background\n",
    "   population in the cPCA space. Get euclidean distance matrix\n",
    "   for all subjects and get the minimum spanning tree (minimum\n",
    "   distance path) from any subject to the background samples.\n",
    "   Then this can be used for every subject to calculate a score\n",
    "   using the shortest distance to the background sample's centroid\n",
    "   Lastly every subject is ordered according to these values."
