The DP_prep_imp_tot.R script prepares the data to be processed in MATLAB 
with the b_DP_imp.m script (which uses the bb_DP_run_imp.m script). The 
script removes outliers and participants with too much missing data. It 
assumes the data will then be imputed in MATLAB and loaded into R again 
(see section #### IMPUTE DATA WITH MATLAB).

Yasser recommended using Trimmed Score Regression (TSR.m script) for imputation, 
but it is probably worth checking if you think this is the optimal way of 
imputation for us. In addition, itâ€™s worth reconsidering the threshold of 
missing data for excluding participants. Usually a large part of the processing 
power/time in the NeuroPM toolbox is taken up by imputing data, so having an 
imputed dataset as input reduces this substantially.
