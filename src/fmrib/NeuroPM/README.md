### This is guidance for new users of the CCRF-adapted Matlab version of the cTI methodology
##### Put 3 model input files into the "/io" folder;
```
Standardised features
Standardised covariables
cTI_group labels (i.e a single column of 1 label per row)
```

##### Open run_NeuroPM.m file and edit the input 
```
filenames in the 3 relevant lines to match what is in the 
"/io" folder. Change the output filenames if desired.
```
