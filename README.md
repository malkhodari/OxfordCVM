### MLflow for Fully Automated ML-OPs

### CI/CD

### Projects Lead By Me
•	Bayesian dimensionality reduction, cluster analysis, and network analysis of population-wide medical databases (UK Biobank) for isolating predictive biomarkers and constructing disease progression trajectories

•	Scalable, interactive, and light weight visualization tools for sharing statistical outcomes from modelling
